Module 6 Challenge


Acknowledgements: Tutor - David Pecot for review of Pandas material specifically Module 4 which helped with grouping and aggregation of
 data in Pandas that was helpful for both Module 5 and Module 6 challenges. I rewatched all three lectures and reviewed solutions to activities specifically Module 6 Day 3 activities (02-Ins_Geoapify_Places, 03-Stu_Geoapify_Drills, and 04-Ins_Nearest-Restaurants) which help me to figure out how to correctly create the URL to pull Hotel information. I also leaned heavily on Pandas documentation, Open Weather Map documentation, Geopapify documentation specifically on categories for Hotels (i.e categories = accomodation.hotel) to be able to pull Hotel name. Most of my issues where Syntax errors as well as a of not defining Bias outside of the Forward loop to bring in the lat and lng from the hotel_df.
